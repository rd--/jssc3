# DegreeToKey- convert signal to modal pitch

_DegreeToKey(table, in, octave)_

The input signal value is truncated to an integer value and used as an index into an octave repeating table of note values. Indices wrap around the table and shift octaves as they do.

- table: an instance of FloatArray or Signal which contains the steps for each scale degree.
- in: the input signal.
- octave: the number of steps per octave in the scale. The default is 12.

Modal space, mouse controls discrete pitch in dorian mode:

	var b = [0, 2, 3.2, 5, 7, 9, 10].asLocalBuf;
	var k = DegreeToKey(b, MouseX(0, 15, 0, 0.1), 12);
	var c = {
		arg n, r;
		var o = SinOsc((r + k + (n * 0.04)).midiCps, 0) * 0.1;
		var t = LFPulse([48, 55].midiCps, 0, 0.15);
		var f = (SinOsc(0.1, 0) * 10 + r).midiCps;
		var d = RLPF(t, f, 0.1) * 0.1;
		var m = o + d;
		CombN(m, 0.31, 0.31, 2) + m
	};
	var n = LFNoise1([3, 3]);
	(c.value(n, 48) + c.value(n, 72)) * 0.25

# GetTempo - continuous tempo

_GetTempo()_

Gives the current tempo as a control rate signal.  Tempo is always in beats per second.

	SetTempo(MouseX(0.25, 4, 1, 0.2))

Use the tempo to modulate an oscillator:

	SinOsc(400 * GetTempo(), 0, 0.2);

# Impulse - impulse oscillator

_Impulse(freq, phase)_

Outputs non band limited single sample impulses.

- freq: frequency in Hertz
- phase: initial phase

Constant frequency:

	Impulse(800, 0) * 0.2

Modulate frequency:

	Impulse(XLn(800, 100, 5), 0) * 0.2

# Index - index into a table with a signal

_Index(table, in)_

The input signal value is truncated to an integer value and used as an index into the table.  Out of range index values are clipped to the valid range.

- table: an instance of FloatArray or Signal.
- in: the input signal.

Index buffer for frequency values:

	var b = [50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600].asLocalBuf;
	var f = Index(b, LinLin(LFSaw(2, 0), -1, 1, 0, 6));
	SinOsc([f, f * 9], 0) * 0.1

# Integrator - leaky integrator

_Integrator(in, leak)_

Integrates an input signal with a leak. The formula implemented is: _out(0) = in(0) + (leak * out(-1))_

- in: input signal
- leak: leak coefficient.

As filter:

	Integrator(LFPulse(300, 0, 0.2) * 0.1, 0.9)

Used as an envelope:

	Integrator(LFPulse(3, 0, 0.2) * 0.0004, 0.999) * FSinOsc(700, 0)

# K2A - control rate to audio rate converter

_K2A(in)_

Control rate signals are not legal outputs. If you want to output a control signal you need to convert it to audio rate. K2A converts via linear interpolation.

- in: input signal

Control rate white noise interpolated to audio rate.

	K2A(WhiteNoise().kr * 0.2)

# Lag - exponential lag

_Lag(in, lagTime)_

This is essentially the same as OnePole except that instead of supplying the coefficient directly, it is caculated from a 60 dB lag time. This is the time required for the filter to converge to within 0.01 % of a value. This is useful for smoothing out control signals.

- in: input signal
- lagTime: 60 dB lag time in seconds.

As filter:

	var x = LFPulse(300, 0, 0.5) * 0.1;
	[x, Lag(x, 0.002)]

Used to lag pitch:

	SinOsc( // sine wave
	  Lag( // lag the modulator
		LFPulse(4, 0, 0.5) * 50 + 400, // frequency modulator
		Ln(0, 1, 15) // modulate lag time
	  ),
	0) // phase
	* 0.3 // sine amplitude

# Latch - sample and hold

_Latch(in, trig)_

Holds input signal value when triggered.

- in: input signal.
- trig: trigger. Trigger can be any signal. A trigger happens when the signal changes from non-positive to positive.

Step noise:

	Latch(WhiteNoise(), Impulse(900, 0)) * 0.1

Step noise as frequency input:

	Blip(Latch(WhiteNoise(), Impulse(9, 0)) * 400 + 500, 4) * 0.1

The above are just meant as examples. LFNoise0 is a faster way to generate random steps:

	Blip(LFNoise0(9) * 400 + 500, 4) * 0.1
