# OverlapTexture - overlap events

_OverlapTexture(newEventFunc, sustainTime, transitionTime, overlap)_

Creates a series of overlapped sounds from a user function. The user function should return a graph of unit generators that produce a continuous sound.  OverlapTexture will apply an envelope to the sound to cross fade different invocations of the user function. OverlapTexture is a convenience class built upon Spawn.

- newEventFunc: You supply a function that returns a graph of unit generators. If it returns nil, then no event is spawned this time. This function is passed one argument, a trigger that is reset for each new event.
- sustainTime: the sustain time (in beats) of the envelope.
- transitionTime: the transition time (in beats)  of the envelope. The envelope transition is a welch envelope segment giving it a -3dB midpoint.
- overlap: number of overlapping events.

There are many examples of OverlapTexture in the examples files.

	var lfo = LFNoise0(lfoFreq) * 1000 + 1200;

		}, 4, 2, 4) * 0.02,
		lfo, // cutoff freq
		MouseX(0.2, 0.02, 1, 0.2) // filter bandwidth

	var delayTime = 2 / lfoFreq;
	var right = DelayC(left, delayTime, delayTime); // delay right channel by two beats
