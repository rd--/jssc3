# Formlet - FOF-like filter

_Formlet(in, freq, attackTime, decayTime)_

This is a resonant filter whose impulse response is like that of a sine wave with a Decay2 envelope over it.  It is possible to control the attacktime and decaytime.

Formlet is equivalent to _Ringz(in, freq, decaytime) - Ringz(in, freq, attacktime)_.

Note that if _attacktime = decaytime_ then the signal cancels out and if _attacktime > decaytime_ then the impulse response is inverted.

The great advantage to this filter over FOF is that there is no limit to the number of overlapping grains since the grain is just the impulse response of the filter.

- in: input signal to be processed
- freq: resonant frequency in Hertz
- attackTime: 60 dB attack time in seconds.
- decayTime: 60 dB decay time in seconds.

Fixed parameters:

	Formlet(Impulse(20, 0) * 0.5, 1000, 0.01, 0.1)

Fixed parameters, modulate frequency of input signal:

	Formlet(Blip(XLn(10, 400, 8), 1000) * 0.1, 1000, 0.01, 0.1)

Modulating formant frequency:

	var input = Blip(SinOsc(5, 0) * 20 + 300, 1000) * 0.1;
	Formlet(input, XLn(1500, 700, 8), 0.005, 0.04)

# LeakDC - remove DC

_LeakDC(in, coef)_

This filter removes a DC offset from a signal.

- in: input signal.
- coef: leak coefficient.

Add DC to a pulse wave and then remove it:

	var a = LFPulse(800, 0, 0.5) * 0.5 + 0.5;
	[a * 0.1, LeakDC(a, 0.995) * 0.1]

# Limiter - peak limiter

_Limiter(input, level, lookAheadTime)_

Limits the input amplitude to the given level. Limiter will not overshoot like _Compander_ will, but it needs to look ahead in the audio. Thus there is a delay equal to twice the lookAheadTime.

Limiter, unlike Compander, is completely transparent for an in range signal.

- input: the signal to be processed.
- level: the peak output amplitude level to which to normalize the input.
- lookAheadTime: the buffer delay time. Shorter times will produce smaller delays and quicker transient response times, but may introduce amplitude modulation artifacts.

	var z = Decay2(Impulse(8, 0) * (LFSaw(0.25, 0) * -0.6 + 0.7), 0.001, 0.3) * FSinOsc(500, 0);

# LPF - 2nd order Butterworth lowpass filter

	WhiteNoise() * 0.1

and:

# LPZ2 two zero fixed lowpass

Compare:

	WhiteNoise() * 0.1

	LPZ2(WhiteNoise() * 0.1)

# Median - median filter

_Median(length, in)_

Returns the median of the last length input points.  This non linear filter is good at reducing impulse noise from a signal.

- length: number of input points in which to find the median. Must be an odd number from 1 to 31. If length is 1 then Median has no effect.
- in: input signal to be processed

A signal with impulse noise.

	Saw(500) * 0.1 + (Dust2(100) * 0.9)

After applying median filter:

	var z = Saw(500) * 0.1 + (Dust2(100) * 0.9);
	Median(3, z)

The median length can be increased for longer duration noise.

A signal with longer impulse noise:

	Saw(500) * 0.1 + (LPZ1(Dust2(100) * 0.9))

Length 3 doesn't help here because the impulses are 2 samples long.

	var z = Saw(500) * 0.1 + (LPZ1(Dust2(100) * 0.9));
	Median(3, z)

Length 5 does better:

	var z = Saw(500) * 0.1 + (LPZ1(Dust2(100) * 0.9));
	Median(5, z)

Long Median filters begin chopping off the peaks of the waveform:

	var x = SinOsc(1000, 0) * 0.1;
	XFade2(x, Median(31, x), MouseX(-1, 1, 0, 0.2), 1)

Another noise reduction application:

	WhiteNoise() + SinOsc(800, 0) * 0.1

Use Median filter for high frequency noise:

	var z = WhiteNoise() + SinOsc(800, 0) * 0.1;
	Median(31, z)

Use LeakDC for low frequency noise:

	var z = WhiteNoise() + SinOsc(800, 0) * 0.1;
	LeakDC(Median(31, z), 0.9)

# Normalizer - flattens dynamics

_Normalizer(input, level, lookAheadTime)_

Normalizes the input amplitude to the given level. Normalize will not overshoot like Compander will, but it needs to look ahead in the audio. Thus there is a delay equal to twice the lookAheadTime.

- input: the signal to be processed.
- level: the peak output amplitude level to which to normalize the input.
- lookAheadTime: the buffer delay time. Shorter times will produce smaller delays and quicker transient response times, but may introduce amplitude modulation artifacts.

Example signal to process:

	var z = Decay2(Impulse(8, 0) * (LFSaw(0.25, 0) * -0.6 + 0.7), 0.001, 0.3) * FSinOsc(500, 0);

# OneZero - one zero filter

_OneZero(in, coef)_

A one zero filter. Implements the formula _out(i) = ((1 - abs(coef)) * in(i)) + (coef * in(i-1))_.

- in: input signal to be processed
- coef: feed forward coefficient. +0.5 makes a two point averaging filter (see also LPZ1), -0.5 makes a differentiator (see also HPZ1),  +1 makes a single sample delay (see also Delay1), -1 makes an inverted single sample delay.

Low pass:

	OneZero(WhiteNoise() * 0.2, 0.5)

	OneZero(WhiteNoise() * 0.2, -0.5)

Modulate coeficient:

	OneZero(WhiteNoise() * 0.2, Ln(-0.5, 0.5, 10))
