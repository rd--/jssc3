<h1>5. Parallel &amp; Series - Programmatic Patch Construction</h1><p>The ability to construct patches programmatically is one of the unique and powerful features of SuperCollider. It allows you to create structures whose size and complexity are determined at runtime.</p><h2>5.1 How to build parallel structures</h2><p>As discussed in the previous section Mix can be used to mix parallel structures.  We can use Array.fill to fill an Array with a number of variations of some structure which we mix together using Mix.</p><p>Mixing sine oscillators in parallel:</p><pre><code>var n = 16; // number of structures to make
var f = { FSinOsc(Rand(200, 1200), 0) }; // function to create an oscillator at a random frequency
f.dup(n).sum / (8 * n) // array of n places, summed, scale amplitude
</code></pre><p>Filling an Array and mixing it is a common idiom:</p><pre><code>{ ... }.dup(n).sum
</code></pre><p>One common structure used in reverbs is to mix several comb delays in parallel.  This example shows how you can use parallel structures to process a single input.</p><pre><code>var n = 8;
// variable to hold the input, use a noise burst as an input signal
var z = Decay2( // exponential decay envelope
	Impulse(0.5, 0), // impulse to trigger the decay
	0.01, // attack time
	0.20 // decay time
) * PinkNoise() * 0.1;	// multiply envelope by pink noise
{
	// function to create comb delays with random delay times
	CombC(
		z, // input signal
		0.1, // maximum delay time
		Rand(0.01, 0.09), // random delay time from 0.01 to 0.09 seconds
		3 // echo decay time
	)
}.dup(n).sum
</code></pre><h1>5.2 How to build series structures.</h1><p>Another structure used in reverbs is a series of allpass delays.  A series or chain of unit generators can be created by using a loop with an induction variable.  In the following loop the variable <em>z</em> gets reassigned each time through the loop creating a chain of allpass delays. The first time though the loop the variable <em>z</em> is the input signal generator.  <em>Z</em> is then assigned to the allpass delay, so that the next time through the loop the next allpass delay will have the previous allpass delay as its input.</p><pre><code>var n = 8;
// variable to hold the input, use a noise burst as an input signal
var z = Decay2( // exponential decay envelope
	Impulse(0.5, 0), // impulse to trigger the decay
	0.01, // attack time
	0.20 // decay time
) * PinkNoise() * 0.1;	// multiply envelope by pink noise
// z begins as the input and gets reassigned each time through the loop
n.timesRepeat({ // do n times
	// function to create allpass delays with random delay times
	z = AllpassN(
		z, // input to this allpass
		0.05, // maximum delay time
		Rand(0, 0.05), // random delay time
		3 // echo decay time
	)
});
z // return z as the output
</code></pre><h1>5.3 Conditional patch construction</h1><p>Patches can be constructed conditionally at runtime.  The following example uses conditional code to randomly construct a patch each time.</p><pre><code>// frequency control
var freq = [LFNoise0(3), FSinOsc(3, 0)].choose * 500 + 800;
// amplitude control
var amp = [LFNoise1(2.2).max(0) * 0.5, FSinOsc(2.2, 0) * 0.25 + 0.25].choose;
// sound source
[SinOsc(freq, 0), Blip(freq, 8)].choose * amp * 0.2
</code></pre>
