# 1.3 A First Taste In OOP Terms

This is the same program as in [1.0 First Steps], but this time documented extensively in OOP terms for exercise.  Mark all OOP buzzwords in here.

Tell the Sc object, i.e. the class _Sc_ to play (i.e. evaluate) the following function, which creates an audio signal when executed.  Create a function (or more precisely, an instance of the class _Function_), which returns the Ugen objects that Sc will play.  Create a (fast) sine oscillator object using it's classes default constructor, which requires a frequency value (here 220 Hz) and a phase value (here 0 radians).  close the argument list for SinOsc and modify it's amplitude using the multiplier binary operator.  Close the function, which implies returning its result, close the parentheses of the argument list to Sc.play, and that's it!

````
Sc.play({
	FSinOsc(
		220,
		0
	)
	* 0.1
})
````
