# 2.7 Removing UgensWhat happens if you do not remove Ugens after they have played?Try it here:````(Synth.play( {	Spawn.ar( {		FSinOsc.ar(			// add a new sine oscillator with every new event,			100 + 1900.0.rand,	// with a frequency of 100  + a random number						// between 0 and 1900 so you can hear every new one.			0.01) 			// at an amplitude of 0.01 so you can add many of them						// before distorting.		},		1, 				// 1 channel,		1, 				// a new event every second,		200)				// stop after 200.	} ))````You can see how the CPU load and the Ugen count go up and up and up...  This sound makes it easy to notice the mistake, bacause you can hear all the running sounds; however, with many filter-based sound you may not hear a very quiet sound that lingers on and on, so you have to take care to remove them.````(Synth.play( {	Spawn.ar( {		Impulse.ar(0, 1)	// an Impulse generator Ugen with a frequency of 0,					// i.e. it plays one impulse and is dead silent after that.		},		1, 			// 1 channel,		0.5, 			// a new event every 0.5 seconds,		200)			// stop after 200.	} ))````````(var e;e = Env.new([0, 1, 0], [0, 0.1]); // (plot it and/or look it up...)Synth.play( {	Spawn.ar( {		Impulse.ar(0, 1)		// plug the Impulse generator into the EnvGen's input.		* EnvGen.ar(e)		// make an EnvGen with a very short envelope.		}, 				// close newEventFunc		1, 				// 1 channel,		1, 				// a new event every second,		200)				// stop after 200.	} ))````Note how the Envelope removes every new instance of Impulse after it has played.(I know you can get the same sound without Spawn by using just an Impulse UGen with of frequency 2 Hz, but I was trying to make the example here as simple as possible.)Next are Programming Techniques: [3.1 Testing - Ask the System!]
